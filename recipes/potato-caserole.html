    <h3>The potato casserole is great for vegetarians looking to get their healthy or unhealthy dose
        of cheese!</h3>
        <p>
            The potato casserole was first created in 1950 after the Second World War. Its creators had hoped
            to make a dish so irresistible that anyone who tried it would immediately give up any ambitions
            or hopes to conquer the world or do bad to others. In other words, the potato casserole became the first
            technology ever created with the sole intention of bringing about world peace.</p>
        <p>
            As the potato casserole began making its way around the world, people were shocked, not only by 
            its immaculate taste, but also for its incredibly beneficial psychological effects. Word
            quickly spread about its incredbly properties and soon everybody wanted to try a bite of 
            this exquisite dish. As the potato casserole and its followers began to grow around the world, so did
            its enemies and the people who wanted to see its destruction. Eventually, two new superpowers
            arose with one side supporting the potato casserole and one seeking to destroy it. As nuclear war seemed
            to be the inevitable end, both sides struck a truce which allowed the potato casserole to retain
            its tasty properties but would have to forgo its tranquil psychological effects. </p>
